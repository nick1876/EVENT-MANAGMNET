            <p>Hello GLAdiators💫💫
              Still, in 2013, when SAO asked her to organize a hackathon as part of the upcoming .Astronomy 5 conference, Humber felt like she was suddenly on unfamiliar ground. “I was scared out of my mind when this ﬁrst dropped in my lap,” she said.
Since breaking onto the scene in 1999, hackathons have conjured images of dim rooms of glassy-eyed developers slouched over screens, working feverishly for 24 hours or more toward some obscure techno-logical solution. Even as recently as 2013, when Humber was ﬁrst called on to put one together, their presence was somewhat alien at meetings and conferences.
